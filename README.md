# Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark
Wireshark packet capture and analysis project demonstrating DNS, HTTP, HTTPS and ICMP protocols.
## Wireshark
Wireshark is a network analysis tool that examines traffic moving across wired and wireless networks. It captures packets as they travel between devices, allowing users to inspect the details of network communications.  
## Protocol Analysis Summary

### 1. DNS Traffic Analysis (`udp.port == 53`)
<img width="1355" height="559" alt="DNS (UDP)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a721848f-2337-4242-b41d-7a794418ce8b" />

**Purpose**: Capture domain name resolution traffic  
**Key Findings**:
- Resolved domains: `wikipedia.org`, `google.com`
- Record types observed:
  - `A` records (IPv4)
  - `AAAA` records (IPv6)
  - `CNAME` aliases (e.g., `wikipedia.org` → `dyna.wikimedia.org`)  

---

### 2. HTTP Traffic Analysis (`http`)
<img width="1359" height="562" alt="http" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/059e8392-9c40-4864-8a57-0fff99627c0f" />

**Purpose**: Examine unencrypted web traffic  
**Key Findings**:
- Request/Response pairs captured:
  - `GET /projex.htm HTTP/1.1` → `200 OK` (success)
  - `GET /archives/2013/...` → `404 Not Found` (error)
  - Multiple `304 Not Modified` responses (cached content)
- Headers:
  - User-Agent strings
  - Server responses with content types (e.g., `text/html`)

---

### 3. HTTPS/TLS Analysis (`tls`)
<img width="1363" height="556" alt="TLS" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f68ba63-34fc-42fe-a7a7-b5194d9282b6" />

**Purpose**: Inspect encrypted web traffic  
**Key Findings**:
- TLS 1.3 handshake observed with `www.google.com`:
  1. `Client Hello` (SNI: `www.google.com`)
  2. `Server Hello` (Cipher suite negotiation)
  3. `Application Data` (Encrypted content)
- Port 443 traffic verified

---

### 4. ICMP Analysis (`icmp`)
<img width="1353" height="542" alt="ICMP" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44571ce8-298d-4baa-bbcf-12717a1cad0a" />

**Purpose**: Test network connectivity  
**Key Findings**:
- Ping exchange with `8.8.8.8` (Google DNS):
  - Echo requests (TTL=64)
  - Echo replies (TTL=112)
- Average RTT: 50ms (visible in packet timestamps)

---

### 5. OCSP Traffic (Observed)

<img width="1358" height="561" alt="OSCP" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7961feb5-86bc-421f-ad96-e3bff27052b2" />  

**Background Protocol**: Online Certificate Status Protocol   
**Findings**:
- Automatic certificate validation checks to:
  - `2404:6800:4007:836...` (Google services)
  - `2405:201:c4oe:6699...` (OCSP responder)

---

## Key Technical Takeaways
**Protocol Isolation**: Successfully filtered and analyzed 4 core protocols  
**Real-World Traffic**: Captured both intentional (tested) and background traffic  

**Security Observations**:
  - Contrasted HTTP (plaintext) vs HTTPS (encrypted)  
  - Identified certificate validation via OCSP  

## Files Included
- `Wireshark Network Capture.pcap`: Raw packet data
- Screenshots: 
  - `dns_traffic.png`  
  - `http_requests.png`  
  - `tls_handshake.png`
  - `ICMP.png`
  - `OSCP.PNG`

## Conclusion
Wireshark serves as an essential tool for network professionals, showing in-depth analysis of network communications through its packet capture and inspection capabilities. The software allows to examine network traffic in detail, identifying and troubleshooting connectivity issues while verifying proper protocol implementation.
